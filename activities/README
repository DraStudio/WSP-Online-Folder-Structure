Place all of your non-Deliverable Activities completed during the WSP-Online course in this folder.

DELIVERABLE files (e.g. Wireframes, Composites) should be turned-in via the indicated media server/dropbox folder, as they are larger binary files and will bloat your GitHub account.

Use this naming convention (substituting the current year, the current month, your own name and appopriate file extension):
wspYYMM-last_first-assignment.xxx
